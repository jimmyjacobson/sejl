# simple-express-json-logger

simple-express-json-logger is a simple express middleware that will output a very simple log in JSON format.

requestTimeLength is in milliseconds.

## Usage

    var express = require('express');
    var simpleJsonLogger = require('simple-express-json-logger');
    // Setup your express app
    var app = express();
    app.use(simpleJsonLogger());

Now on every request, you'll get something similar to this:

    {"path":"/","method":"GET","requestTimeLength":"6.55","ua":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.71 Safari/537.36","ip":"::1","time":"2015-10-21 13:35:37"}

### Logstash UDP support ###

If you supply a host and a port when you initiate simple-express-json-logger, you'll get log entries to your UDP server.

    var express = require('express');
    var simpleJsonLogger = require('simple-express-json-logger');
    // Setup your express app
    var app = express();
    // Send message via udp to logstash.server.com:12345
    app.use(simpleJsonLogger('logstash.server.com', 12345));

Setup your logstash server like so:

    input {
      udp {
        port => 12345
        type => 'node-logs' // Or whatever you want the logs to show up as
        codec => 'json'
      }
      output {
        // Whatever you want
      }
    }

You can also use the optional flag to turn off the console.log message so you can get only the UDP message sent.

    app.use(simpleJsonLogger('logstash.server.com', 12345, { disableConsole: true }));

You can log environmental variables as well, like by adding them to the array in your options:

    app.use(simpleJsonLogger('logstash.server.com', 12345, {
      loggedFromEnv: ['envVar1', 'envVar2']
    ));

You can also add arbitrary tags that will get forwarded to your logs.  

    app.use(simpleJsonLogger('logstash.server.com', 12345, {
      tags: ['web server 1', 'staging environment']
    ));
